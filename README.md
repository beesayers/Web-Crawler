Web Crawler
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this program is to implement a web crawler which will start at a given web page and follow all web-pages that are linked from the starting page, then follows all links from those pages, and so on and so forth. To keep track of the links, a breadth first style is implemented using a queue or stack of either a limited or unlimited size. The program prints the title of each webpage it visits.
To run the program correctly follow these steps:

1) Build the program                                                                          
2) Run the program                                                                              
3) When prompted for data ensure you enter the correct data type (i.e. an integer, a string, etc.)
